Cardobot is an application created for fun by Elegroth from the Cheeky Unts discord.

To install, just make sure you are in the same directory as the INSTALL file and validate that the file is executable.

If both are true, just execute the INSTALL file
    ./INSTALL

This requires you to have write access to both your home directory and /usr/bin/

If you do not have access to either, you will need to run this with elevated permissions, aka sudo.

VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

HAVE FUN!
